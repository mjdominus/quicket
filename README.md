Quickette - Very simple ticketing system

# Underlying principles

1. A ticket is a markdown file

2. Worse is better

Additional [design notes](DESIGN-NOTES.md) and miscellaneous
[technical notes](TECH-NOTES.md).

# Note

Original plan was to name it "quicket", but there's a big venue-ticket
processor named that.  "Quickette" is better anyway.
